This was made for a small business that wanted to pay nothing for the infrastructure maintenance and wanted it ASAP. They don't care that the code is public. This could be made a lot more stable by constantly communicating with some remote RDBMS rather than just using sqlite and backing it up manually in admin. I did it this way so it would be fast, responsive, could be created in one day, and will have an ongoing cost of nothing. Technically, backing up to s3 costs some fraction of a penny, but I'm happy calling that "nothing". If you're already paying for a lot more infrastructure, you should probably use that instead. Pointing this to a remote DB should be very easy, I've provided the table schemas and everything.

**The security features are garbage. Don't rely on them!** I tried to go at least a little further than the basic approach shown [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/deploy/authentication-without-sso) to make the password harder to brute force, but you could just [use a managed service](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/connections/authentication) or you could [use streamlit-authenticator](https://blog.streamlit.io/streamlit-authenticator-part-1-adding-an-authentication-component-to-your-app/), which seems pretty cool.

**Streamlit will dumb the sqlite db on every reboot!** If you really wanted to, you could just manually stick the backed up db back into the environment with the code editor, but that's a very janky way to get persistence.


Your secrets.toml should look like this:

```
[connections.db]
url = "foo"

[passwords]
admin = "foo"
kitchen = "foo"


[aws]
access_key_id = "foo"
secret_access_key = "foo"
bucket_name = "foo"
region = "foo"
``` 

Obviously, you also have to set up an IAM role with PutObject permissions for wherever you are putting the backup.

With this app, I'm continuing my habit of dedicating a full day to going from nothing to an MVP. In this case there was way more work than I thought. In hindisght, maybe I should have made this a normal React app. I had not used Streamlit before this. I assumed it would help much more than it did.
