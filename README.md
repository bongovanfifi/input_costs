I'm continuing my habit of dedicating a full day to finishing at least the MVP of a project. In this case there was way more work than I though, and in hindisght I should have made this a normal React app, I had not used Streamlit but I assumed it would help much more than it did.

The security features are, I expect, garbage. Don't rely on them.
